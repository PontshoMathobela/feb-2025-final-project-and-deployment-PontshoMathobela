      <h2>Welcome to Blogging 101</h2>
      <p>
        If you're new to blogging, don't worry — you've come to the right place! 
        This guide will walk you through the basics of starting your blog journey, whether you're writing for fun, sharing your thoughts, or building a personal brand.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Choose Your Niche</h3>
      <p>
        A blog niche is the main topic you want to write about. Choose something you're passionate about or interested in — like tech, food, travel, or personal stories.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Pick a Platform</h3>
      <p>
        Platforms like WordPress, Blogger, or even GitHub Pages (like this site!) allow you to create and publish your blog. For developers, using HTML/CSS is a great start!
      </p>

      <h3>3. Plan Your Content</h3>
      <p>
        Make a list of blog ideas. Start with beginner-friendly topics and keep your writing clear and engaging. Don’t worry about perfection — consistency is key!
      </p>

      <h3>4. Add Visuals</h3>
      <p>
        Use images, illustrations, or even videos to make your blog more attractive and readable. Make sure you use copyright-free visuals or your own.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Share Your Blog</h3>
      <p>
        Once your post is ready, share it with friends or on social media. Getting feedback is a great way to improve and grow your audience.
